.SH Spot
.PP
Spot (aka \f[V]simplotask\f[R]) is a powerful and easy-to-use tool for
effortless deployment and configuration management.
It allows users to define a playbook with the list of tasks and targets,
where each task consists of a series of commands that can be executed on
remote hosts concurrently.
Spot supports running scripts, copying files, syncing directories, and
deleting files or directories, as well as custom inventory files or
inventory URLs.
.SS Getting Started
.IP \[bu] 2
Install Spot by download the latest release from the
Releases (https://github.com/umputun/spot/releases) page.
.IP \[bu] 2
Create a configuration file, as shown in the example below, and save it
as \f[V]spot.yml\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
Run Spot using the following command: \f[V]spot\f[R].
This will execute all the tasks defined in the default
\f[V]spot.yml\f[R] file for the \f[V]default\f[R] target with a
concurrency of 1.
.IP \[bu] 2
To execute a specific task, use the \f[V]--task\f[R] flag:
\f[V]spot --task=deploy-things\f[R].
This will execute only the \f[V]deploy-things\f[R] task.
.IP \[bu] 2
To execute a specific task for a specific target, use the
\f[V]--task\f[R] and \f[V]-t\f[R] flags:
\f[V]spot --task=deploy-things -t prod\f[R].
This will execute only the \f[V]deploy-things\f[R] task for the
\f[V]prod\f[R] target.

.SS Basic Concepts
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Playbook\f[R] is a YAML or TOML file that defines a list of tasks
to be executed on one or more target hosts.
Each task consists of a series of commands that can be executed on the
target hosts.
Playbooks can be used to automate deployment and configuration
management tasks.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Task\f[R] is a named set of commands that can be executed on one or
more target hosts.
Tasks can be defined in a playbook and can be executed concurrently on
multiple hosts.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Command\f[R] is an action that can be executed on a target host.
Spot supports several built-in commands, including copy, sync, delete,
script, echo and wait.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Target\f[R] is a host or group of hosts on which a task can be
executed.
Targets can be specified directly in a playbook or can be defined in an
inventory file.
Spot supports several inventory file formats.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Inventory\f[R] is a list of targets that can be used to define the
hosts and groups of hosts on which a task can be executed.

.SS Simplified playbook example
.PP
In some cases the rich syntax of the full playbook is not needed and can
felt over-engineered and even overwhelming.
For those situations, Spot supports a simplified playbook format, which
is easier to read and write, but also more limited in its capabilities.

.SS Playbook Types
.PP
Spot supports two types of playbooks: full and simplified.
Both can be represented in either YAML or TOML format.
The full playbook is more powerful and flexible but also more verbose
and complex.
The simplified playbook, on the other hand, is easier to read and write
but has more limited capabilities.
.PP
Here are the main differences between the two types of playbooks:
.IP \[bu] 2
The full playbook supports multiple target sets, while the simplified
playbook only supports a single target set.
In other words, the full playbook can execute the same set of commands
on multiple environments, with each environment defined as a separate
target set.
The simplified playbook can execute the same set of commands on just one
environment.
.IP \[bu] 2
The full playbook supports multiple tasks, while the simplified playbook
only supports a single task.
This means that the full playbook can execute multiple sets of commands,
whereas the simplified playbook can only execute one set of commands.
.IP \[bu] 2
The full playbook supports various target types, such as
\f[V]hosts\f[R], \f[V]groups\f[R], and \f[V]names\f[R], while the
simplified playbook only supports a single type, which is a list of
names or host addresses.
See the Targets section for more details.
.IP \[bu] 2
The simplified playbook does not support task-level \f[V]on_error\f[R],
\f[V]user\f[R], and \f[V]ssh_key\f[R] fields, while the full playbook
does.
See the Task details section for more information.
.IP \[bu] 2
The simplified playbook also has \f[V]target\f[R] field (in addition to
\f[V]targets\f[R]) allows to set a single host/name only.
This is useful when user want to run the playbook on a single host only.
The full playbook does not have this field.
.PP
Both types of playbooks support the remaining fields and options.
.SS Tasks and Commands
.PP
Each task consists of a list of commands that will be executed on the
remote host(s).
The task can also define the following optional fields:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]on_error\f[R]: specifies the command to execute on the local host
(the one running the \f[V]spot\f[R] command) in case of an error.
The command can use the \f[V]{SPOT_ERROR}\f[R] variable to access the
last error message.
Example:
\f[V]on_error: \[dq]curl -s localhost:8080/error?msg={SPOT_ERROR}\[dq]\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]user\f[R]: specifies the SSH user to use when connecting to remote
hosts.
Overrides the user defined in the top section of playbook file for the
specified task.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]targets\f[R] - list of target names, group, tags or host addresses
to execute the task on.
Command line \f[V]-t\f[R] flag can be used to override this field.
The \f[V]targets\f[R] field may include variables.
For more details see Dynamic targets section.
.PP
\f[I]Note: these fields supported in the full playbook type only\f[R]
.PP
All tasks are executed sequentially one a given host, one after another.
If a task fails, the execution of the playbook will stop and the
\f[V]on_error\f[R] command will be executed on the local host, if
defined.
Every task has to have \f[V]name\f[R] field defined, which is used to
identify the task everywhere.
Playbook with missing \f[V]name\f[R] field will fail to execute
immediately.
Duplicate task names are not allowed either.
.SS Relative paths resolution
.PP
Relative path resolution is a frequent issue in systems that involve
file references or inclusion.
Different systems handle this in various ways.
Spot uses a widely-adopted method of resolving relative paths based on
the current working directory of the process.
This means that if you run Spot from different directories, the way
relative paths are resolved will change.
In simpler terms, Spot doesn\[aq]t resolve relative paths according to
the location of the playbook file itself.
.PP
This approach is intentional to prevent confusion and make it easier to
comprehend relative path resolution.
Generally, it\[aq]s a good practice to run Spot from the same directory
where the playbook file is located when using relative paths.
Alternatively, you can use absolute paths for even better results.
.SS Command Types
.PP
Spot supports the following command types:
.SS \f[V]script\f[R]
.PP
Can be any valid shell script.
The script will be executed on the remote host(s) using SSH, inside a
shell.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
script: |
  ls -laR /tmp
  du -hcs /srv
  cat /tmp/conf.yml
  echo all good, 123
\f[R]
.fi
.SS \f[V]copy\f[R]
.PP
Copies a file from the local machine to the remote host(s).
If \f[V]mkdir\f[R] is set to \f[V]true\f[R] the command will create the
destination directory if it doesn\[aq]t exist, same as
\f[V]mkdir -p\f[R] in bash.
The command also supports glob patterns in \f[V]src\f[R] field.
.PP
Copy command performs a quick check to see if the file already exists on
the remote host(s) with the same size and modification time, and skips
the copy if it does.
This option can be disabled by setting \f[V]force: true\f[R] flag.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
- name: copy file with mkdir
  copy: {\[dq]src\[dq]: \[dq]testdata/conf.yml\[dq], \[dq]dst\[dq]: \[dq]/tmp/conf.yml\[dq], \[dq]mkdir\[dq]: true}

- name: copy files with glob
  copy: {\[dq]src\[dq]: \[dq]testdata/*.csv\[dq], \[dq]dst\[dq]: \[dq]/tmp/things\[dq]}


- name: copy files with force flag
  copy: {\[dq]src\[dq]: \[dq]testdata/*.csv\[dq], \[dq]dst\[dq]: \[dq]/tmp/things\[dq], \[dq]force\[dq]: true}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Copy also supports list format to copy multiple files at once:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
- name: copy files with glob
  copy:
    - {\[dq]src\[dq]: \[dq]testdata/*.csv\[dq], \[dq]dst\[dq]: \[dq]/tmp/things\[dq]}
    - {\[dq]src\[dq]: \[dq]testdata/*.yml\[dq], \[dq]dst\[dq]: \[dq]/tmp/things\[dq]}
\f[R]
.fi
.SS \f[V]sync\f[R]
.PP
Synchronises directory from the local machine to the remote host(s).
Optionally supports deleting files on the remote host(s) that don\[aq]t
exist locally with \f[V]\[dq]delete\[dq]: true\f[R] flag.
Another option is \f[V]exclude\f[R] which allows to specify a list of
files to exclude from the sync.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
- name: sync directory
  sync: {\[dq]src\[dq]: \[dq]testdata\[dq], \[dq]dst\[dq]: \[dq]/tmp/things\[dq]}

- name: sync directory with delete
  sync: {\[dq]src\[dq]: \[dq]testdata\[dq], \[dq]dst\[dq]: \[dq]/tmp/things\[dq], \[dq]delete\[dq]: true}

- name: sync directory with exclude
  sync: {\[dq]src\[dq]: \[dq]testdata\[dq], \[dq]dst\[dq]: \[dq]/tmp/things\[dq], \[dq]exclude\[dq]: [\[dq]*.txt\[dq], \[dq]*.yml\[dq]]}
  
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Sync also supports list format to sync multiple paths at once.
.SS \f[V]delete\f[R]
.PP
Deletes a file or directory on the remote host(s), optionally can remove
recursively.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
- name: delete file
  delete: {\[dq]path\[dq]: \[dq]/tmp/things.csv\[dq]}
- name: delete directory recursively
  delete: {\[dq]path\[dq]: \[dq]/tmp/things\[dq], \[dq]recur\[dq]: true}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Delete also supports list format to remove multiple paths at once.
.SS \f[V]wait\f[R]
.PP
Waits for the specified command to finish on the remote host(s) with 0
error code.
This command is useful when user needs to wait for a service to start
before executing the next command.
Allows to specify the timeout as well as check interval.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
- name: wait for service to start
  wait: {\[dq]cmd\[dq]: \[dq]curl -s --fail localhost:8080\[dq], \[dq]timeout\[dq]: \[dq]30s\[dq], \[dq]interval\[dq]: \[dq]1s\[dq]}
\f[R]
.fi
.SS \f[V]echo\f[R]
.PP
Prints the specified message to the console.
This command is useful for debugging purposes and also to print the
value of variables to the console.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
- name: print message
  echo: \[dq]hello world\[dq]
- name: print variable
  echo: $some_var
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Command options
.PP
Each command type supports the following options:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]ignore_errors\f[R]: if set to \f[V]true\f[R] the command will not
fail the task in case of an error.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]no_auto\f[R]: if set to \f[V]true\f[R] the command will not be
executed automatically, but can be executed manually using the
\f[V]--only\f[R] flag.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]local\f[R]: if set to \f[V]true\f[R] the command will be executed
on the local host (the one running the \f[V]spot\f[R] command) instead
of the remote host(s).
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]sudo\f[R]: if set to \f[V]true\f[R] the command will be executed
with \f[V]sudo\f[R] privileges.
This option is not supported for \f[V]sync\f[R] command type but can be
used with any other command type.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]only_on\f[R]: allows to set a list of host names or addresses where
the command will be executed.
For example, \f[V]only_on: [host1, host2]\f[R] will execute command on
\f[V]host1\f[R] and \f[V]host2\f[R] only.
This option also supports reversed condition, so if user wants to
execute command on all hosts except some, \f[V]!\f[R] prefix can be
used.
For example, \f[V]only_on: [!host1, !host2]\f[R] will execute command on
all hosts except \f[V]host1\f[R] and \f[V]host2\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]cond\f[R]: defines a condition for the command to be executed.
The condition is a valid shell command that will be executed on the
remote host(s) and if it returns 0, the primary command will be
executed.
For example, \f[V]cond: \[dq]test -f /tmp/foo\[dq]\f[R] will execute the
primary script command only if the file \f[V]/tmp/foo\f[R] exists.
Condition can be reversed by adding \f[V]!\f[R] prefix, i.e.
\f[V]! test -f /tmp/foo\f[R] will pass only if file \f[V]/tmp/foo\f[R]
doesn\[aq]t exist.
Please note that \f[V]cond\f[R] option supported for \f[V]script\f[R]
command type only.
.PP
example setting \f[V]ignore_errors\f[R], \f[V]no_auto\f[R] and
\f[V]only_on\f[R] options:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
  commands:
      - name: wait
        script: sleep 5s
        options: {ignore_errors: true, no_auto: true, only_on: [host1, host2]}
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Script Execution
.PP
Spot allows executing scripts on remote hosts, or locally if
\f[V]options.local\f[R] is set to true.
Scripts can be executed in two different ways, depending on whether they
are single-line or multi-line scripts.
.PP
\f[B]Single-line Script Execution\f[R]
.PP
For single-line scripts, they are executed directly inside the shell
with the optional parameters set to the command line.
For example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
  commands:
      - name: some command
        script: ls -laR /tmp
        env: {FOO: bar, BAR: qux} 
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
this will be executed as:
\f[V]FOO=\[aq]bar\[aq] BAR=\[aq]qux\[aq]ls -laR /tmp FOO=bar BAR=qux\f[R]
inside the shell on the remote host(s), i.e.
\f[V]sh -c \[dq]FOO=\[aq]bar\[aq] BAR=\[aq]qux\[aq]ls -laR /tmp FOO=bar BAR=qux\[dq]\f[R].
.PP
\f[B]Multi-line Script Execution\f[R]
.PP
For multi-line scripts, Spot creates a temporary script containing all
the commands, uploads it to the remote host (or keeps it locally if
\f[V]options.local\f[R] is set to true), and executes the script.
Environment variables are set inside the script, allowing the user to
create complex scripts that include setting variables, conditionals,
loops, and other advanced functionality.
Scripts run with \[dq]set -e\[dq] to fail on error.
For example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
commands:
  - name: multi_line_script
    script: |
      touch /tmp/file1
      echo \[dq]Hello World\[dq] > /tmp/file2
      echo \[dq]Executing loop...\[dq]
      for i in {1..5}; do
        echo \[dq]Iteration $i\[dq]
      done
      echo \[dq]All done! $FOO $BAR
    env: {FOO: bar, BAR: qux}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
this will create a temporary script on the remote host(s) with the
following content and execute it:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#!/bin/sh
set -e
export FOO=\[aq]bar\[aq]
export BAR=\[aq]qux\[aq]
touch /tmp/file1
echo \[dq]Hello World\[dq] > /tmp/file2
echo \[dq]Executing loop...\[dq]
for i in {1..5}; do
  echo \[dq]Iteration $i\[dq]
done
echo \[dq]All done! $FOO $BAR\[dq]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
By using this approach, Spot enables users to write and execute more
complex scripts, providing greater flexibility and power in managing
remote hosts or local environments.
.SS Passing variables from one script command to another
.PP
Spot allows to pass variables from one command to another.
This feature is especially useful when a command, often a script, sets a
variable, and the subsequent command requires this variable.
For instance, if one command creates a file and the file name is needed
in another command.
To pass these variables, user must use the conventional shell\[aq]s
export directive in the initial script command.
Subsequently, all variables exported in this initial command will be
accessible in the following commands.
.PP
For example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
commands:
  - name: first command
    script: |
      export FILE_NAME=/tmp/file1
      touch $FILE_NAME
  - name: second command
    script: |
      echo \[dq]File name is $FILE_NAME\[dq]
  - name: third command
    copy: {src: $FILE_NAME, dest: /tmp/file2}
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Targets
.PP
Targets are used to define the remote hosts to execute the tasks on.
Targets can be defined in the playbook file or passed as a command-line
argument.
The following target types are supported:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]hosts\f[R]: a list of destination host names or IP addresses, with
optional port and username, to execute the tasks on.
Example:
\f[V]hosts: [{host: \[dq]h1.example.com\[dq], user: \[dq]test\[dq], name: \[dq]h1}, {host: \[dq]h2.example.com\[dq], \[dq]port\[dq]: 2222}]\f[R].
If no user is specified, the user defined in the top section of the
playbook file (or override) will be used.
If no port is specified, port 22 will be used.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]groups\f[R]: a list of groups from inventory to use.
Example: \f[V]groups: [\[dq]dev\[dq], \[dq]staging\[dq]}\f[R].
Special group \f[V]all\f[R] combines all the groups.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]tags\f[R]: a list of tags from inventory to use.
Example: \f[V]tags: [\[dq]tag1\[dq], \[dq]tag2\[dq]}\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]names\f[R]: a list of host names from inventory to use.
Example: \f[V]names: [\[dq]host1\[dq], \[dq]host2\[dq]}\f[R].
.PP
All the target types can be combined, i.e.
\f[V]hosts\f[R], \f[V]groups\f[R], \f[V]tags\f[R], \f[V]hosts\f[R] and
\f[V]names\f[R] all can be used together in the same target.
To avoid possible duplicates, the final list of hosts is deduplicated by
the host+ip+user.
.PP
example of targets set in the playbook file:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
targets:
  prod:
    hosts: [{host: \[dq]h1.example.com\[dq], user: \[dq]test\[dq]}, {\[dq]h2.example.com\[dq], \[dq]port\[dq]: 2222, name: \[dq]h2\[dq]}]
  staging:
    groups: [\[dq]staging\[dq]]
  dev:
    groups: [\[dq]dev\[dq], \[dq]staging\[dq]]
    names: [\[dq]host1\[dq], \[dq]host2\[dq]]
  all-servers:
    groups: [\[dq]all\[dq]]

tasks:
  - name: task1
    targets: [\[dq]dev\[dq], \[dq]host3.example.com:2222\[dq]]
    commands:
      - name: command1
        script: echo \[dq]Hello World\[dq]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
\f[I]Note: All the target types available in the full playbook file
only.
The simplified playbook file only supports a single, anonymous target
type combining \f[VI]hosts\f[I] and \f[VI]names\f[I] together.\f[R]
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
targets: [\[dq]host1\[dq], \[dq]host2\[dq], \[dq]host3.example.com\[dq], \[dq]host4.example.com:2222\[dq]]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
in this example, the playbook will be executed on hosts named
\f[V]host1\f[R] and \f[V]host2\f[R] from the inventory and on hosts
\f[V]host3.example.com\f[R] with port \f[V]22\f[R] and
\f[V]host4.example.com\f[R] with port \f[V]2222\f[R].
.SS Target overrides
.PP
There are several ways to override or alter the target defined in the
playbook file via command-line arguments:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]--inventory\f[R] set hosts from the provided inventory file or url.
Example: \f[V]--inventory=inventory.yml\f[R] or
\f[V]--inventory=http://localhost:8080/inventory\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]--target\f[R] set groups, names, tags from inventory or directly
hosts to run playbook on.
Example: \f[V]--target=prod\f[R] (will run on all hosts in group
\f[V]prod\f[R]) or \f[V]--target=example.com:2222\f[R] (will run on host
\f[V]example.com\f[R] with port \f[V]2222\f[R]).
User name can be provided as a part of the direct target address as
well, i.e.
\f[V]--target=user2\[at]example.com:2222\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]--user\f[R] set the ssh user to run the playbook on remote hosts.
Example: \f[V]--user=test\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]--key\f[R] set the ssh key to run the playbook on remote hosts.
Example: \f[V]--key=/path/to/key\f[R].
.SS Target selection
.PP
The target selection is done in the following order:
.IP \[bu] 2
if \f[V]--target\f[R] is set, it will be used.
.RS 2
.IP \[bu] 2
first Spot will try to match on target name in the playbook file.
.IP \[bu] 2
if no match found, Spot will try to match on group name in the inventory
file.
.IP \[bu] 2
if no match found, Spot will try to match on tags in the inventory file.
.IP \[bu] 2
if no match found, Spot will try to match on host name in the inventory
file.
.IP \[bu] 2
if no match found, Spot will try to match on host address in the
playbook file.
.IP \[bu] 2
if no match found, Spot will use it as a host address.
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
if \f[V]--target\f[R] is not set, Spot will try check it
\f[V]targets\f[R] list for the task.
If set, it will use it following the same logic as above.
.IP \[bu] 2
and finally, Spot will assume the \f[V]default\f[R] target.
.SS Dynamic targets
.PP
Spot offers support for dynamic targets, allowing the list of targets to
be defined dynamically using variables.
This feature becomes particularly useful when users need to ascertain a
destination address within one task, and subsequently use it in another
task.
Here is an illustrative example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
tasks:
  - name: get host
    targets: [\[dq]default\[dq]]
    script: |
      export thehost=$(curl -s http://example.com/next-host)
    options: {local: true}
    
  - name: run on host
    targets: [\[dq]$thehost\[dq]]
    script: |
      echo \[dq]doing something on $thehost\[dq]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
In this example, the host address is initially fetched from
<http://example.com/next-host>.
Following this, the task \[dq]run on host\[dq] is executed on the host
that was just identified.
This ability to use dynamic targets proves beneficial in a variety of
scenarios, especially when the list of hosts is not predetermined.
.PP
A practical use case for dynamic targets arises during the provisioning
of a new host, followed by the execution of commands on it.
Since the IP address of the new host isn\[aq]t known beforehand, dynamic
retrieval becomes essential.
.PP
\f[I]The reason the first task specifies
\f[VI]targets: [\[dq]default\[dq]]\f[I] is because Spot requires some
target to execute a task.
In this case, all commands in \[dq]get host\[dq] tasks are local and
won\[aq]t be invoked on a remote host.
The \f[VI]default\f[I] target is utilized by Spot if no alternative
target is specified via the command line.\f[R]
.SS Inventory
.PP
The inventory file is a simple yml (or toml) what can represent a list
of hosts or a list of groups with hosts.
In case if both groups and hosts defined, the hosts will be merged with
groups and will add a new group named \f[V]hosts\f[R].
.PP
By default, inventory loaded from the file/url set in
\f[V]SPOT_INVENTORY\f[R] environment variable.
This is the lowest priority and can be overridden by \f[V]inventory\f[R]
from the playbook (next priority) and \f[V]--inventory\f[R] flag
(highest priority) .
This is an example of the inventory file with groups
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
groups:
  dev:
    - {host: \[dq]h1.example.com\[dq], name: \[dq]h1\[dq], tags:[\[dq]us-east1\[dq], \[dq]vpc-1234567\[dq]]}
    - {host: \[dq]h2.example.com\[dq], port: 2233, name: \[dq]h2\[dq]}
    - {host: \[dq]h3.example.com\[dq], user: \[dq]user1\[dq]}
    - {host: \[dq]h4.example.com\[dq], user: \[dq]user2\[dq], name: \[dq]h4\[dq]}
  staging:
    - {host: \[dq]h5.example.com\[dq], port: 2233, name: \[dq]h5\[dq]}
    - {host: \[dq]h6.example.com\[dq], user: \[dq]user3\[dq], name: \[dq]h6\[dq]}
\f[R]
.fi
.IP \[bu] 2
host: the host name or IP address of the remote host.
.IP \[bu] 2
port: the ssh port of the remote host.
Optional, default is 22.
.IP \[bu] 2
user: the ssh user of the remote host.
Optional, default is the user defined in the playbook file or
\f[V]--user\f[R] flag.
.IP \[bu] 2
name: the name of the remote host.
Optional.
.IP \[bu] 2
tags: the list of tags of the remote host.
Optional.
.PP
In case if port not defined, the default port 22 will be used.
If user not defined, the playbook\[aq]s user will be used.
.PP
This is an example of the inventory file with hosts only (no groups)
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
hosts:
  - {host: \[dq]hh1.example.com\[dq], name: \[dq]hh1\[dq]}
  - {host: \[dq]hh2.example.com\[dq], port: 2233, name: \[dq]hh2\[dq], user: \[dq]user1\[dq]}
  - {host: \[dq]h2.example.com\[dq], port: 2233, name: \[dq]h2\[dq], tags:[\[dq]us-east1\[dq], \[dq]vpc-1234567\[dq]]}
  - {host: \[dq]h3.example.com\[dq], user: \[dq]user1\[dq], name: \[dq]h3\[dq]}
  - {host: \[dq]h4.example.com\[dq], user: \[dq]user2\[dq], name: \[dq]h4\[dq]}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
This format is useful when you want to define a list of hosts without
groups.
.PP
In each case inventory automatically merged and a special group
\f[V]all\f[R] will be created that contains all the hosts.
.PP
\f[I]Alternatively, the inventory can be represented using the TOML
format.\f[R]
.SS Export
.PP
Spot supports export all the destination from selected/matched targets
to the file or stdout.
This is useful when user want to use the same
hosts/ports/server-names/etc in other systems.
By default, with \f[V]--gen\f[R] option, Spot will export to stdout in
json format.
To export to the file, \f[V]--gen.output=/path/to/file\f[R] option can
be used.
.PP
This exported list of destinations can be consumed by other system, but
practically it will require some conversion from the spot\[aq]s json to
the format that is supported by the system.
This can be addressed by injecting
\f[V]jq\f[R] (https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) into the mix but spot also
offers a better solution - templating with the standard go templates.
To turn this feature on, \f[V]--gen.template=/path/to/template\f[R]
option can be used.
.PP
Example of the template file, showing all the fields that can be used:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
{{- range .}}
\[dq]Name\[dq]: \[dq]{{.Name}}\[dq]
\[dq]Host:Port\[dq]: \[dq]{{.Host}}:{{.Port}}\[dq]
\[dq]User\[dq]: \[dq]{{.User}}\[dq]
\[dq]Tags\[dq]: [{{range .Tags}}\[dq]{{.}}\[dq]{{end}}]
{{- end -}}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
\f[I]for more info see go
templates (https://pkg.go.dev/text/template)\f[R]
.SS Runtime variables
.PP
Spot supports runtime variables that can be used in the playbook file.
The following variables are supported:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]{SPOT_REMOTE_HOST}\f[R]: The remote host name or IP address.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]{SPOT_REMOTE_NAME}\f[R]: The remote custom name, set in inventory
or playbook as \f[V]name\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]{SPOT_REMOTE_USER}\f[R]: The remote username.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]{SPOT_COMMAND}\f[R]: The command name.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]{SPOT_TASK}\f[R]: The task name.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]{SPOT_ERROR}\f[R]: The error message, if any.
.PP
Variables can be used in the following places: \f[V]script\f[R],
\f[V]copy\f[R], \f[V]sync\f[R], \f[V]delete\f[R], \f[V]wait\f[R] and
\f[V]env\f[R], for example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
tasks:
  deploy-things:
    commands:
      - name: copy configuration
        copy: {\[dq]src\[dq]: \[dq]{SPOT_REMOTE_HOST}/conf.yml\[dq], \[dq]dst\[dq]: \[dq]/tmp/conf.yml\[dq], \[dq]mkdir\[dq]: true}
      - name: sync things
        sync: {\[dq]src\[dq]: \[dq]testdata\[dq], \[dq]dst\[dq]: \[dq]/tmp/{SPOT_TASK}/things\[dq]}
      - name: some command
        script: |
          ls -laR /tmp/${SPOT_COMMAND}
        env: { FOO: bar, BAR: \[dq]{SPOT_COMMAND}-blah\[dq] }
      - name: delete things
        delete: {\[dq]loc\[dq]: \[dq]/tmp/things/{SPOT_REMOTE_USER}\[dq], \[dq]recur\[dq]: true}
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Ad-hoc commands
.PP
Spot supports ad-hoc commands that can be executed on the remote hosts.
This is useful when all is needed is to execute a command on the remote
hosts without creating a playbook file.
This command optionally passed as a first argument, i.e.
\f[V]spot \[dq]la -la /tmp\[dq]\f[R] and usually accompanied by the
\f[V]--target=<host>\f[R] (\f[V]-t <host>\f[R]) flags.
Example:
\f[V]spot \[dq]ls -la\[dq] -t h1.example.com -t h2.example.com\f[R].
.PP
All other overrides can be used with adhoc commands as well, for example
\f[V]--user\f[R]and \f[V]--key\f[R] to specify the user and sshkey to
use when connecting to the remote hosts.
By default, Spot will use the current user and the default ssh key.
Inventory can be passed to such commands as well, for example
\f[V]--inventory=inventory.yml\f[R].
.PP
Adhoc commands always sets \f[V]verbose\f[R] to \f[V]true\f[R]
automatically, so the user can see the output of the command.
.SS Rolling Updates
.PP
Spot supports rolling updates, which means that the tasks will be
executed on the hosts one by one, waiting for the previous host to
finish before starting the next one.
This is useful when you need to update a service running on multiple
hosts, but want to avoid downtime.
To enable rolling updates, use the \f[V]--concurrent=N\f[R] flag when
running the \f[V]spot\f[R] command.
\f[V]N\f[R] is the number of hosts to execute the tasks on concurrently.
Example: \f[V]spot --concurrent=2\f[R].
In addition, user can use a builtin \f[V]wait\f[R] command to wait for a
service to start before executing the next command.
See the Command Types section for more details.
Practically, user will have a task with a series of commands, where the
last command will wait for the service to start by running a command
like \f[V]curl -s --fail localhost:8080\f[R] and then the task will be
executed on the next host.
.SS Secrets
.PP
Spot supports secrets, which are encrypted string values that can be
used in the playbook file.
This feature is useful for storing sensitive information, such as
passwords or API keys.
Secrets are encrypted, and their values are decrypted at runtime.
Spot supports three types of secret providers: built-in, Hashicorp
Vault, and AWS Secrets Manager.
Other providers can be added by implementing the
\f[V]SecretsProvider\f[R] interface with a single \f[V]GetSecrets\f[R]
method.
.PP
Using secrets is simple.
First, users need to define a secret provider in the command line
options or environment variables.
Then, users can add secrets to any command in the playbook file by
setting \f[V]options.secrets\f[R], as shown in the following example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
tasks:
  - name: access sensitive data
    commands:
      - name: read api response
        script: |
          curl -s -u ${user}:${password} https://api.example.com  
          curl https://api.example.com -H \[dq]Authorization: Bearer ${token}\[dq]
        options:
          secrets: [user, password, token]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
In this case secrets for keys \f[V]user\f[R], \f[V]password\f[R] and
\f[V]token\f[R] will be read from the secrets provider, decrypted at
runtime and passed to the command in environment.
Please note: if a user runs \f[V]spot\f[R] with the \f[V]--verbose\f[R]
or \f[V]--dbg\f[R] flag, the secrets will be replaced with
\f[V]****\f[R] in the output.
This is done to prevent secrets from being displayed or logged.
.SS Built-in Secrets Provider
.PP
Spot includes a built-in secrets provider that can be used to store
secrets in sqlite, mysql or postgresql database.
The provider can be configured using the following command line options
or environment variables:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]--secrets.provider=spot\f[R]: selects the built-in secret\[ga]s
provider.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]--secrets.conn\f[R] or \f[V]$SPOT_SECRETS_CONN\f[R]: the connection
string to the database
.RS 2
.IP \[bu] 2
sqlite: \f[V]file:///path/to/database.db\f[R] or
\f[V]/path/to/database.sqlite\f[R] or \f[V]/path/to/database.db\f[R],
default: \f[V]spot.db\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
mysql: \f[V]user:password\[at]tcp(host:port)/dbname\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
postgresql:
\f[V]postgres://user:password\[at]host:port/database?option1=value1&option2=value2\f[R]
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]--secrets.key\f[R] or \f[V]$SPOT_SECRETS_KEY\f[R]: the encryption
key to use for decrypting secrets.
.PP
If \f[V]spot\f[R] provider is selected, the table \f[V]spot_secrets\f[R]
will be created in the database.
The table has the following columns: \f[V]skey\f[R] and \f[V]sval\f[R].
The \f[V]skey\f[R] column is the secret key, and the \f[V]sval\f[R]
column is the encrypted secret value.
The \f[V]skey\f[R] column is indexed for faster lookups.
It is recommended to use application-specific prefixes for the secret
keys, for example \f[V]system-name/service-name/secret-key\f[R].
This will allow to use the same database for multiple applications
without conflicts.
.PP
The built-in secrets provider uses strong cryptography techniques to
ensure the safety of your secrets.
Below is a summary of the security methods employed:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Argon2 key derivation\f[R]: The Argon2 key derivation function
(argon2.IDKey) is used to derive a 32-byte key from the provided user
key and a randomly generated salt.
This function is memory-hard and designed to be resistant to GPU-based
attacks, providing increased security for your secrets.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]NaCl SecretBox encryption\f[R]: Secrets are encrypted and decrypted
using the NaCl SecretBox package, which provides authenticated
encryption with additional data.
It uses XSalsa20 for encryption and Poly1305 for authentication,
ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of the stored secrets.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Random nonces and salts\f[R]: Spot generates random nonces for each
encryption operation and random salts for each key derivation operation.

.SS Why Spot?
.PP
Spot is simple.
It only has a few basic commands with a very limited set of options and
flags.
The playbook is just a list of commands to run, plus a list of remote
targets to apply those commands against.
Each command is made to be as intuitive and as direct as possible.
Despite its simplicity, Spot is surprisingly powerful and can help get
things done.
This tool was built out of frustration with the complexity of similar
tools.
All I wanted was something that is simple, easy to use, easy to
understand, and capable of handling most of the usual deployment tasks.
I didn\[aq]t want to have to check documentation or resort to googling
every time I used it.
Spot is the result of that effort.

.PP
In conclusion, Spot is a powerful and easy-to-use tool that simplifies
the process of deployment and configuration management while offering
the flexibility and extensibility needed to cater to various use cases.
.SS Is it replacing Ansible?
.PP
Spot is not designed as a direct replacement for Ansible; however, in
certain use cases, it can address the same challenges effectively.
While both tools can be used for deployment and configuration
management, there are some key differences between them:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Complexity\f[R]: Ansible is a more feature-rich and mature tool,
offering a wide range of modules and plugins that can automate many
different aspects of infrastructure management.
Spot, on the other hand, is designed to be simple and lightweight,
focusing on a few core features to streamline the deployment and
configuration process.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Learning Curve\f[R]: Due to its simplicity, Spot has a lower
learning curve compared to Ansible.
It\[aq]s easier to get started with Spot, making it more suitable for
smaller projects or teams with limited experience in infrastructure
automation.
Ansible, while more powerful, can be more complex to learn and
configure, especially for newcomers.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Customization\f[R]: While both tools offer customization options,
Ansible has a more extensive set of built-in modules and plugins that
can handle a wide range of tasks out-of-the-box.
Spot, in contrast, relies on custom scripts and a limited set of
built-in commands for its functionality, which might require more manual
configuration and scripting for certain use cases.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Community and Ecosystem\f[R]: Ansible has a large and active
community, as well as a vast ecosystem of roles, modules, and
integrations.
This can be beneficial when dealing with common tasks or integrating
with third-party systems.
Spot, being a smaller and simpler tool, doesn\[aq]t have the same level
of community support or ecosystem.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Ease of installation and external dependencies\f[R]: One of the
most significant benefits of Spot is that it has no dependencies.
Being written in Go, it is compiled into a single binary that can be
easily distributed and executed on various platforms.
This eliminates the need to install or manage any additional software,
libraries, or dependencies to use Spot.
Ansible, on the other hand, is written in Python and requires Python to
be installed on both the control host (where Ansible is run) and the
managed nodes (remote hosts being managed).
Additionally, Ansible depends on several Python libraries, which need to
be installed and maintained on the control host.
Some Ansible modules may also require specific libraries or packages to
be installed on the managed nodes, adding to the complexity of managing
dependencies.
.PP
Spot is an appealing choice for those seeking a lightweight, simple, and
easy-to-use tool for deployment and configuration management, especially
for smaller projects or when extensive features aren\[aq]t necessary.
Its single binary distribution, easy-to-comprehend structure, and
minimal dependencies offer a low-maintenance solution.
However, if a more comprehensive tool with a wide range of built-in
modules, plugins, and integrations is needed, Ansible may be a better
fit.
While Ansible has advanced features and a robust ecosystem, its reliance
on Python and additional libraries can sometimes be less convenient in
certain environments or situations with specific constraints.
