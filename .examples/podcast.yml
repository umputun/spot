# This playbook used to deploy a new podcast episode to radio-t.com.
# It uploads mp3 file to the master node, copy to archive and to local NAS and cleans old files,
# then it uploads mp3 file to all nodes and cleans old files on each node
# This example demonstrates how to get input from CLI and use it in the playbook as well as how to set and use local variables
# Another interesting thing here - this playbook deploying things to two sets of destinations (master and nodes)
# and this is why it's done in two tasks.
targets:

# this task expects "mp3" param (full location of mp3 file) to be set by cli, i.e. -e mp3:/Podcasts/radio-t/123/rt_podcast123.mp3
